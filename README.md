# YChanEx
Thread downloader for some imageboards.

You can get the original (and outdated) application here:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/ychan/

# Supported chans
4chan (API)  
420chan (API)  
7chan (HMTL Parsing, no API)  
8chan (API)  
fchan (HTML Parsing, no API)  
u18chan (HTML Parsing, no API)  

Want me to add one of your favorites? Open an issue and I'll look into it. \*chans with an API can get supported faster than no-API \*chans
